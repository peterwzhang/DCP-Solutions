Good morning! Here's your coding interview problem for today.

This problem was asked by Facebook.

Given a number in Roman numeral [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_numerals] 
format, convert it to decimal.

The values of Roman numerals are as follows:

{
    'M': 1000,
    'D': 500,
    'C': 100,
    'L': 50,
    'X': 10,
    'V': 5,
    'I': 1
}


In addition, note that the Roman numeral system uses subtractive notation
[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subtractive_notation] for numbers such as IV and 
XL.

For the input XIV, for instance, you should return 14.
